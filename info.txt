- Raycast isn't hitting the nodes for some reason => Astar fails because only 14 connections are found...
	- Maybe there is some logic here specific to the project
	- Maybe its intersecting with the floor's collider
		- raise the spheres slightly off the ground

- Make movement work with astar (along nodes)
	- Record the last move a player made (w, a, s, d) and use that as the next direction 

	- Continuously raycast in transform.forward
		- If node, AStar to that node
		- If wall, AStar to node in direction of player's last move
